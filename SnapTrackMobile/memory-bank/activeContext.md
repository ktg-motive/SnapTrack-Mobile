  - **USER FLOW:**
    1. App opens → Check user authentication → Check subscription status
    2. No subscription → PaidAccountRequiredScreen with "Create Account" button
    3. Button redirects to https://snaptrack.bot/signup?source=mobile&return=snaptrack://auth/payment-complete
    4. User completes payment on web → Deep link returns to app with success/failure

## Previous Work Focus - Emergency Android Release (July 15, 2025 AM)

- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Emergency Android Crash Fix (July 15, 2025)
  - **CRITICAL BUG:** Android app crashes during receipt processing with "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" error
  - **ROOT CAUSE 1:** Conditional style rendering with `&&` operator causing React Native to interpret objects as text
  - **ROOT CAUSE 2:** FormData Content-Type header conflict causing "multipart != application/json" network errors
  - **SOLUTION 1:** Replaced all `condition && styles.style` with `...(condition ? [styles.style] : [])`  
  - **SOLUTION 2:** Added FormData detection in API client to prevent Content-Type: application/json override
  - **AFFECTED FILES:** ReviewScreen.tsx (6 style fixes), apiClient.ts (FormData detection)
  - **TESTING:** Confirmed Android receipt processing working end-to-end without crashes
  - **DEPLOYMENT:** v1.3.3 APK deployed to Firebase App Distribution for Android testers

- ✅ **COMPLETED:** API Client FormData Fix (July 15, 2025)
  - **NETWORK ERROR:** `/api/parse` endpoint failing with "multipart != application/json" on Android
  - **TECHNICAL ISSUE:** API client was setting Content-Type: application/json for all requests including FormData
  - **PROPER BEHAVIOR:** FormData requests need runtime-generated Content-Type with boundary parameter
  - **IMPLEMENTATION:** Added `isFormData` check to conditionally set Content-Type header
  - **CROSS-PLATFORM:** Fix improves both Android and iOS reliability (iOS was more tolerant)
  - **RESULT:** Receipt uploads now work correctly without simulator fallback

## Previous Work Focus - Session July 13, 2025 (Afternoon)

- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Navigation Design Restoration (July 13, 2025)

  - **QUICKSTATS FIX:** Final fix for "All Time" total amount calculation
    - API's total_amount only includes first 1000 receipts
    - Now calculates from full receipts array like Statistics screen
    - Receipt count still uses accurate API value
  - **CONSISTENCY:** QuickStats and Statistics screens now show identical totals

## Previous Work Focus - Session July 13, 2025 (Morning)

- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Critical Mobile Bug Fixes (July 13, 2025)

  - **HELP NAVIGATION FIX:** Added Help screen to root Stack Navigator to fix navigation error
  - **CAMERA LIFECYCLE FIX:** Implemented useFocusEffect to properly deactivate camera when not in use
  - **UI POLISH:** Added comma formatting for expense amounts (e.g., $4,641.17)

  - **ASPECT RATIO PRESERVATION:** New receipts now maintain proper portrait/landscape ratios
  - **OCR OPTIMIZATION:** Maintained Google Vision API compatibility with 2048px max dimension
  - **SMART RESIZING:** Portrait receipts constrained by height, landscape by width
  - **BEFORE/AFTER:** Old receipts (2048x2048 squares) vs New receipts (e.g., 1920x2560 portrait)

## Previous Work Focus - Session July 7, 2025

## CRITICAL API CONTRACTS - DO NOT BREAK

**These API contracts are working in production and must be preserved:**

1. **`apiClient.getEntities()` returns `Entity[]` directly**
   - NOT `{data: Entity[]}` - this will break entity selection in ReviewScreen and Settings
   - Backend returns: `{"success": true, "entities": [...], "count": N}`
   - Mobile expects: Direct array of Entity objects

2. **`/api/parse` endpoint response transformation**
   - Backend returns standardized format: `{"success": true, "expense": {...}, "confidence": {...}}`
   - Mobile app has transformation logic in `apiClient.ts` lines 240-273
   - Both new and legacy formats must be supported for backward compatibility

3. **Receipt deletion requires API call + state update**
   - Must call `apiClient.deleteReceipt(receiptId)` first
   - Then update local state with `setReceipts(prev => prev.filter(...))`
   - Missing either step will cause sync issues

4. **Settings navigation uses EnhancedSettingsScreen**
   - Basic SettingsScreen has no entity management
   - AccountScreen → Settings must navigate to EnhancedSettingsScreen
   - Entity management is critical functionality that was working earlier

5. **Dashboard pagination for complete data loading**
   - Default API response limited to 25 receipts per page
   - Must implement pagination loop to load ALL receipts
   - Check `pagination.has_next_page` to continue loading
   - Critical for accurate statistics and entity breakdowns
