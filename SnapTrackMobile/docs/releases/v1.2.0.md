- **OCR Accuracy**: Maintained >95% accuracy with optimized images
- **Upload Speed**: 5-7x improvement in upload performance

### Optimization Strategy
```typescript
// OCR-optimized compression settings
{
  resize: { width: 2048 },     // Google Vision recommended max
  compress: 0.7,               // 70% quality (OCR optimized)
  format: JPEG                 // Efficient format for receipts
}
```
