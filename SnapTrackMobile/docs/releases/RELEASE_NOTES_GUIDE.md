## Release Notes Workflow

### 1. Before Each Release

1. **Update the current templates** with your changes:
   - `testflight/current.txt` - For iOS TestFlight
   - `firebase/current.md` - For Android Firebase

2. **Keep templates in sync** - Both should describe the same changes, just formatted differently.

### 2. During Release (Automated)

When you run `./scripts/release.sh` or `./scripts/update-version-enhanced.sh`:
- The script automatically creates versioned copies (e.g., `v1.3.1.txt`)
- Version numbers are updated in the templates
- Git commits include release information

### 3. TestFlight Format (current.txt)

```
SnapTrack v[VERSION] - [Release Type]

WHAT'S NEW:

TESTING FOCUS:

**Guidelines:**
- Keep it concise (TestFlight has character limits)

## Automation

The release process is automated via scripts:

1. **`./scripts/release.sh`** - Complete release workflow
   - Updates versions
   - Creates release notes
   - Manages git workflow
   - Triggers EAS builds

2. **`./scripts/update-version-enhanced.sh`** - Manual version update
   - Updates all version files
   - Prepares release notes
   - Validates consistency

3. **Version displayed in app**
   - About screen shows dynamic version
   - Pulled from `expo-constants`
   - Always matches build version

## Tips

- Update release notes BEFORE running release scripts
- Review auto-generated notes for accuracy
- Keep historical notes for reference
- Use semantic versioning consistently
- Test locally before releasing
