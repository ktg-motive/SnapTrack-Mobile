## Previous Work Focus - Session July 7, 2025

- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Critical SnapTrack Bug Fixes (July 7, 2025)
  - **CRITICAL FIX 1:** Fixed API response parsing crash during receipt upload
    - Backend `/api/parse` endpoint was returning complex nested format
    - Mobile apps crashed when trying to parse response (but receipts were saved to DB)
    - Standardized backend response to clean format in `/api/parse` endpoint
    - Added transformation logic in `apiClient.ts` lines 240-273 to handle both formats
    - Updated TypeScript interfaces to support both new and legacy formats

## CRITICAL API CONTRACTS - DO NOT BREAK

**These API contracts are working in production and must be preserved:**

1. **`apiClient.getEntities()` returns `Entity[]` directly**
   - NOT `{data: Entity[]}` - this will break entity selection in ReviewScreen and Settings
   - Backend returns: `{"success": true, "entities": [...], "count": N}`
   - Mobile expects: Direct array of Entity objects

2. **`/api/parse` endpoint response transformation**
   - Backend returns standardized format: `{"success": true, "expense": {...}, "confidence": {...}}`
   - Mobile app has transformation logic in `apiClient.ts` lines 240-273
   - Both new and legacy formats must be supported for backward compatibility

3. **Receipt deletion requires API call + state update**
   - Must call `apiClient.deleteReceipt(receiptId)` first
   - Then update local state with `setReceipts(prev => prev.filter(...))`
   - Missing either step will cause sync issues

4. **Settings navigation uses EnhancedSettingsScreen**
   - Basic SettingsScreen has no entity management
   - AccountScreen → Settings must navigate to EnhancedSettingsScreen
   - Entity management is critical functionality that was working earlier

5. **Dashboard pagination for complete data loading**
   - Default API response limited to 25 receipts per page
   - Must implement pagination loop to load ALL receipts
   - Check `pagination.has_next_page` to continue loading
   - Critical for accurate statistics and entity breakdowns
