# SnapTrack Mobile v1.2.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 8, 2025  
**Build Number:** 5 (iOS) / 5 (Android)  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Home Screen Receipt Duplication Fixed
- **Issue:** Pull-to-refresh on home screen was duplicating recent receipts
- **Root Cause:** Pagination state wasn't being reset before refresh, causing stale page numbers
- **Fix:** Always reset `currentPage` to 1 before refresh and fetch page 1 for recent receipts
- **Impact:** Home screen now shows correct, non-duplicated receipts after refresh
- **Note:** Receipts tab was unaffected and continued working correctly

### Technical Details
- Modified `handleRefresh()` to reset pagination state before loading
- Simplified `loadDashboardData()` to always fetch page 1 for recent receipts display
